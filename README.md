## Files/Folders:

* README.md (this file): This file providing information about environment setup for getting started with homework.
* .ipynb: Jupyter notebook file for a warmup assignment which is not graded. 
* .html: An example of expected submission file
* hw.ipynb: Jupyter notebook file containing instruction for the assignment.
* .cvs, .dat, .html: Sample data files



## Notes:

* We need to use Jupyter Notebook for this. Feel free to use any IDE that you prefer. Also, you can use Google colab. We have provided set up code for google colab in the hw1.ipynb file


* COMPLETE THIS PART TO GET FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON BASICS

    From the directory displayed in the browser, select .ipynb, and follow the instructions in the notebook. The warmup will not be graded but it is highly recommended that everyone completes it, especially if you have little to no prior Python or Jupyter notebook knowledge.  Even if you are familiar with Python, you may learn something new that will help you with the homework assignments.
